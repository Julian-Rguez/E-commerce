            The founders of all these fast food chains are [part of] what we
            would call the quintessential American Dream. They were, by and
            large, from humble beginnings. They often grew up poor, didnt
            achieve success until late in their life, and had all these
            setbacks. Colonel Sanders is a key example of somebody who struggled
            his entire life and then struck it rich with a chicken recipe he
            perfected while working at a gas station in southeastern Kentucky.
            There are all of these really impressive stories that I think, in
            another era, we would hold up as the ideal of American success. And
            then theres the food. The food is terrible, and its delicious, and
            its completely ridiculous and we love it. I mean, not everybody
            loves it, but it has this element of hucksterism to it, these insane
            ideas that get made. Its a very American idea to just have the
            biggest, craziest burger or the wildest things. There are all of
